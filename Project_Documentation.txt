LINKRELIEF: TACTICAL DISASTER COORDINATION PLATFORM
================================================================================
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION & MISSION OVERVIEW
Version: 1.0.0
Date: February 2026
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
LinkRelief is a next-generation disaster management ecosystem designed for the 
"Last Mile" of crisis response. Unlike centralized systems that fail during 
network blackouts, LinkRelief emphasizes resilience, speed, and decentralization. 
It enables survivors to send life-saving SOS alerts while providing NGOs with a 
real-time command center to coordinate verified rescue missions.

2. THE PROBLEM SPACE
--------------------
In high-stress disaster scenarios (Earthquakes, Floods, Conflict Zones), three 
critical failure points emerge:
1. Bandwidth Collapse: Traditional apps fail to load assets on 2G/EDGE networks.
2. Information Chaos: Reports are unverified, leading to resource misallocation.
3. Offline Paralysis: Most cloud-based apps disconnect the user the moment 
   signal is lost.

3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------
The platform is built on a modern, modular stack optimized for performance and 
reliability:

- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) with Tailwind CSS for high-performance UI. 
  It utilizes a "Tactical/Postal" theme architecture to maximize readability 
  across varied environment lighting.
- Backend: Express.js (Node.js) acting as a high-speed proxy and resource 
  optimizer.
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for relational data and Realtime channels 
  (Postgres Changes) for instant cross-device updates.
- ORM: Prisma for type-safe database interactions and structured schema handling.
- Graphics: MapLibre GL JS for vector/raster map rendering with client-side 
  dark-mode filtering.

4. CORE FUNCTIONALITIES
-----------------------

4.1 The "3-Tap" Rapid SOS System
Survivors can report emergencies in exactly three interactions:
1. Select Category (Medical, Fire, Flood).
2. Pin Location (Interactively on the Tactical Map).
3. Confirm Severity (Low, Medium, High).
This system minimizes cognitive load during panic and captures GPS data 
automatically without requiring manual address entry.

4.2 Relay Link (Offline Sync Protocol)
The most critical feature for resilient networking. Relay Link uses a persistent 
localStorage queue to store incident reports if the device is offline. When 
connectivity is restored, the system automatically "flushes" the queue to the 
server using a background synchronization hook (`useRelayLink.ts`).

4.3 NGO Command Center & Verification
LinkRelief moves beyond "crowdsourcing" by implementing a strict verification 
hierarchy. NGO administrators must be vetted by the Global Admin. Only verified 
NGOs can "Verify" or "Deploy" resources to an incident, changing the map markers 
from "Unverified/Red" to "Verified/Green" in real-time.

4.4 ScaleDown Image Optimization
The backend implements the "ScaleDown" service using the Sharp library. Every 
image uploaded is aggressively compressed to under 50KB. This ensures that a 
responder in the field can see a situation-report photo even on the weakest 
data connections.

5. SECURITY & DATA PRIVACY
--------------------------
- Environment Isolation: All API keys (Supabase, MapTiler, Prisma) are isolated 
  via .env variables and excluded from Git history.
- Verification Logic: Role-based access controls ensure only authenticated NGO 
  members can modify incident statuses.
- Tactical Privacy: Coordinates are used purely for emergency response and 
  broadcast via secure Realtime channels.

6. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS & IDEAS
------------------------------

6.1 P2P Mesh Communication
Integrate WebRTC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to allow devices within 100 meters 
to "hop" reports to each other until one device reaches a functional cellular 
tower.

6.2 AI-Driven Priority Sorting
Implement a lightweight LLM (on-device) to categorize verbal descriptions or 
image contents to rank the most critical "Rescue" calls during massive casualty 
events.

6.3 Resource Bartering & Logistics Marketplace
Expand the "NGO Team" functionality to allow organizations to trade surplus 
supplies (e.g., 500 blankets for 200 units of insulin) directly through the 
dashboard.

6.4 Satellite Integration
Establish a pipeline for low-bandwidth satellite messaging (e.g., Garmin InReach 
or Starlink Mini) to push incident GeoJSON data through non-terrestrial networks.

7. CONCLUSION
-------------
LinkRelief is more than a dashboard; it is a digital lifeline. By combining 
offline-first architecture with real-time verification, it provides the bridge 
between chaos and coordinated rescue.

8. DEMONSTRATION MANUAL: RELAY LINK
-----------------------------------
To verify the system's resilience in a live environment:
1.  Navigate to the Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/dashboard).
2.  Open Browser DevTools -> Network -> Select "Offline".
3.  Perform a 3-tap SOS report (Category -> Map Pin -> Severity).
4.  Observe the "Saved to Queue" toast notification.
5.  Restore the network to "Online".
6.  The system will automatically sync and push the queued report to the 
    backend, proving the "Zero-Intervention" recovery logic.
